Mini Cora GNN Project

This is a mini project focused on using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for predictive tasks with the Cora dataset.
This project explores the use of GNNs to make predictions on academic research papers in the Cora dataset. 
It's a small-scale project aimed at demonstrating the capabilities of GNNs for document classification tasks.
